Install Gentoo. Do a Linux.

This repo is developed in a subdirectory of ~. Changes are pushed to GitHub, and picked up from there with emaint sync. When creating manifests, tools will have to fetch source tarballs themselves, since they often don't exist on upstream mirrors.

When making changes to ebuilds, copy them into a new revision first
